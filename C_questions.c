These are the hardest question of each Chapter I've covered.

A: nested if
Write a C program to input two numbers, ask the user to select two modes: R & S. (R means Rectangle & S means Square)
After either of the mode is selected, ask the user to select another two modes: A & P. (A means Area & P means Perimeter)
Finally, display the respective information based on the modes selected.

B: switch (NO LOOPS ALLOWED)
Implement a switch program that lets the user select on the following modes and displays the respective logic
and exits after each prompt
1: Profit & Loss Finder
2: Area of Rectangle Finder
3: Area of Square Finder

C: do-while loop
Write a C program by combining switch and do while loop where it displays the following options, performs the respective
logic and exits only when the respective option is selected
1: Profit & Loss Finder
2: Area of Rectangle Finder
3: Area of Square Finder
4: Exit

D: while loop
WAP to display the maximum value of an integer variable using just one variable and a while loop. 
Answer must be: 2147483647

E: for loop
WAP to input a value, multiply it by itself until it reaches less than 0 and display the maximum limit of that value.
You can use three variables. Hint: Temporay Storage!

F: Functions
WAP to use recursive function to print a fibonacci series up to the 15th term without using a loop.

G: Array
WAP to use a single array to store employee count, id, salary and phone number of 10 employees and display them in a tabular form.

H: Structure
WAP to store name, address, contact, id and salary of 10 employees and display their details by sorting their salary in ascending order.

I: Pointer
WAP to print the multiplication table of a given number using pointer and a void function.
Rule: Only 1 variable for asking input can be used; another variable can either be a variable for a loop or a pointer or both.
