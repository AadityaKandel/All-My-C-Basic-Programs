# All-My-C-Basic-Programs
These are just home works of C program! Just what I am being told by my teacher to make!

For those wondering which program to use for compiling and running the c code,
You can use "CodeBlocks" or "Visual Studio Code"

Among these, I find CodeBlocks as the easy to use & install program for C programming. 

# To install CodeBlocks, you can follow the following steps:
Goto "https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries"  [This is the official CodeBlocks website]

As shown in the above figure, you can select a setup package depending on your platform
As most of you have Windows, you can simply click on the first option
Then a list of download links will appear on your screen

Always choose the first option as it is the latest version. 
My preference is "Sourceforge.net" as it will automatically download the file.
Click on "Sourceforge.net" on the first option.
Wait for 5 seconds and it will download the file for you.

After downloading the file, you can either click "Ctrl+J" on your keyboard to open "Downloads"
Or, you can simply head over to the TOP-RIGHT CORNER and you'll see the "download" logo
[Open Your File]

As shown in the figure, you'll also see the same output on your screen. Just click the following buttons respectively
"NEXT"
"I AGREE"
"NEXT"
"INSTALL"

[This will automatically install CodeBlocks on your system]

To open the software, you can either search it on the "Search Box" available on the BOTTOM-LEFT CORNER
Or, you may also see "CodeBlocks" available on your desktop screen.

ENJOY CODING!!
